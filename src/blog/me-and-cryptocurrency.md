Use Gemini to buy Bitcoin. Send BTC from Gemini to KuCoin. Use KuCoin to trade BTC for BNB. Send BNB to TrustWallet. Use TrustWallet to swap BNB for BNB Smart Chain. Connect PancakeSwap to TrustWallet using WalletConnect. Finally, exchange BNB Smart Chain for Safemoon.

The good

- The process is fun
- Figuring it out is rewarding
- The lack of complete documentation makes it fun
- Outdated documentation makes it fun
- Bad UX makes it feel unexplored
- Buying lottery tickets is exciting
- Gambling is fun
- NY state regulations add another barrier to overcome, which is fun
- There's still a subversive feeling to it all
- Inside jokes, slang, memes
- 24/7 movement. No matter the project, there are people in Discord, Twitter, and Reddit having discussions about it. So it satisfies the need for input/consumption
- The never ending web of **things**–apps, extensions, accounts, wallets, etc–to install and use creates that weird, fun spiral where when you get to the bottom you can't even remember where you started
- The action is the juice
- Being early to a project is exciting in the same way that being early to a new API used to be

The bad

- DYOR is childish horseshit. It's also the go-to advice of QAnon.
- Still trying to solve all problems with technology
